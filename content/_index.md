# Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This site is currently still under construction.

This site will be used to publish:

- Blog Posts - related to projects and otherwise.
- Personal Projects - sharing as open source, feel free to leverage for personal and non-commercial uses.
- Personal profile to display contents such as skills and certifications, both currently existing/active and things I am working towards.

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and published using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

See below for my most recent Blog posts, or click the links in the upper-right to navigate to specific sections.
