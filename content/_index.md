# Introduction

Welcome to my personal portfolio site! This site is currently still under construction.

This site will be used to publish:

- Blog Posts, related to projects and otherwise
- Projects
- Personal profile to display contents such as skills and certifications, both currently existing/active and things I am working towards.

This site is built using Hugo, and published using GitHub pages. For now, see my blog for details on how I have been building this page. Once I have the layout completed, I will publish it as a project.

See below for my most recent Blog posts, or click the links in the upper-right to navigate to specific sections.
