## Project Goal

This article serves as an introduction to a comprehensive 12-week AI skilling roadmap focused on developing expertise in AI-infused security solutions using Microsoft technologies. This project combines hands-on learning with practical implementation across Microsoft Security Copilot, Defender XDR, Purview, Fabric, and Azure AI services while building a curated prompt library for security and governance scenarios.

As the project resources are published, the references will be linked below.

## Project Outcomes

- **Comprehensive Prompt Library**: A well-organized collection of AI prompts for security operations, governance, and AI agent scenarios
- **Hugo-based Documentation Site**: Complete project documentation and findings published via GitHub Pages
- **Hands-on Experience**: Practical deployment and configuration experience across the Microsoft security and AI stack
- **Customer-Ready Solutioning Skills**: Framework and toolkit for AI-first security solution architecture and delivery
- **Secure AI Deployment Guide**: End-to-end guide for deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot with security controls
- **Reusable AI Agent Toolkit**: Custom AI agent built with Copilot Studio or Azure AI Foundry
