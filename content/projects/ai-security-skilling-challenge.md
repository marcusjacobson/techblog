> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Project Update**: This project has been restructured from a 12-week to a **9-week focused learning path** based on lessons learned during Week 1. The new structure provides a more logical progression and realistic time investment for working professionals.


## Project Goal

This article serves as an introduction to a comprehensive **9-week AI skilling roadmap** focused on developing expertise in AI-infused security solutions using Microsoft technologies. This project combines hands-on learning with practical implementation across Microsoft Security Copilot, Defender XDR, Purview, Fabric, and Azure AI services while building a curated prompt library for security and governance scenarios.

The project has been optimized for working professionals with a logical progression through 4 distinct phases, designed for 8-12 hours per week (manageable with full-time work).

> **üåç Regional Deployment Guidance**: This project deploys infrastructure to **East US** region for complete AI security coverage and curriculum compliance, ensuring all advanced security features are available for hands-on learning.

As the project resources are published, the references will be linked below.

## Project Outcomes

- **Comprehensive Prompt Library**: A well-organized collection of AI prompts for security operations, governance, and AI agent scenarios
- **Hugo-based Documentation Site**: Complete project documentation and findings published via GitHub Pages
- **Hands-on Experience**: Practical deployment and configuration experience across the Microsoft security and AI stack
- **Customer-Ready Solutioning Skills**: Framework and toolkit for AI-first security solution architecture and delivery
- **Secure AI Deployment Guide**: End-to-end guide for deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot with security controls
- **Reusable AI Agent Toolkit**: Custom AI agent built with Copilot Studio or Azure AI Foundry

## Features

### 9-Week Learning Path Structure

The roadmap is organized into **4 distinct phases** for optimal skill building:

#### **Phase 1: Security Infrastructure Foundations (Weeks 1-3)**

- **Week 1**: [Defender for Cloud Deployment Mastery](/posts/ai-skilling-week-0-project-setup/index.html) - Master Defender for Cloud deployment with modern unified security operations foundation
- **Week 2**: AI Integration & Enhanced Security Operations - Implement AI integration and enhanced security operations platform
- **Week 3**: Defender XDR + Security Copilot Integration - Deploy advanced XDR + Security Copilot integration

#### **Phase 2: Data Governance & Analytics (Weeks 4-5)**

- **Week 4**: Microsoft Purview for Data Governance - Comprehensive data governance implementation
- **Week 5**: Microsoft Priva and Responsible AI - Responsible AI governance frameworks

#### **Phase 3: Advanced Analytics & AI Development (Weeks 6-7)**

- **Week 6**: Microsoft Fabric for Secure Analytics - Secure analytics and data pipelines
- **Week 7**: Azure AI Foundry & Secure AI Workloads - Secure AI workload deployment

#### **Phase 4: Applied AI & Enterprise Delivery (Weeks 8-9)**

- **Week 8**: Copilot Studio for Security Agents - Security agents and AI automation
- **Week 9**: Secure Copilot Deployment & Delivery Practices - Comprehensive delivery practices

### Key Benefits of This Structure

- **Realistic Time Investment**: Each week designed for 8-12 hours total (manageable with full-time work)
- **Logical Learning Flow**: Each phase builds methodically on previous knowledge
- **Balanced Workload**: Complex deployment work separated from AI integration
- **Practical Outcomes**: Every week delivers deployable solutions and reusable assets
- **Enterprise Ready**: Progresses from foundational skills to customer-facing delivery capability

### Deliverables

- **Organized Prompt Library**: Domain-specific categorization (Security, Governance, AI Agents) with weekly contributions
- **Weekly Learning Documentation**: Blog posts documenting findings and learnings for each phase
- **Reference Architectures**: Secure AI deployment patterns and best practices
- **Customer Solutioning Playbooks**: Reusable prompts and frameworks for enterprise delivery
- **Deployment Automation**: Infrastructure as Code templates and deployment guides
- **Regional Deployment Guide**: East US specific configuration for complete AI security coverage

## Repository Structure

The project is organized as a modular structure to support focused development:
