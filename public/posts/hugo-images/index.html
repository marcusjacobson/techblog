Quick update for today, with another Hugo tip. As I have worked with markdown before, specifically while managing Wikis in Azure DevOps and GitHub, I simply created a subdirectory within my repository in the same area as the markdown files for my articles, and then pointed to my image files using the typical syntax of ![alt text](imagelink). When building my site within Hugo, it even properly ported these image files into the public site files, however no matter what I did, my links were broken.">

<p>Quick update for today, with another Hugo tip. As I have worked with markdown before, specifically while managing Wikis in Azure DevOps and GitHub, I simply created a subdirectory within my repository in the same area as the markdown files for my articles, and then pointed to my image files using the typical syntax of <code>![alt text](imagelink)</code>. When building my site within Hugo, it even properly ported these image files into the <strong>public</strong> site files, however no matter what I did, my links were broken.</p>
<p>Naturally, I went down the more complicated rabbit whole for way too long. Based on research, I tried some of the following solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>I learned that Hugo will naturally point to the <strong>static/images</strong> folder for the image files. I copied my stack of images to that folder.
<ul>
<li>Hugo documentation states that these should be referenced in your mardown using <code>images/...</code>. I did this, no dice.</li>
<li>I updated my image mapping to specifically point to <code>static\images...</code>, still no dice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I added an additional parameter within my hugo.toml file: <code>imageDir = &quot;images&quot;</code> to try and make a static reference, and then make an update within the <strong>single.html</strong> file (the template used for blog posts) similar to below. Still nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/techblog/images/customize-hugo/single-html-image-directory-map-fail.png" alt="single-html-image-directory-map-fail"></p>
<p>At this point, I deleted the static mappings from the last step as not to screw up anything in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The solution!</h2>
<p>Then I thought, wait a minute! My content is posted on github pages. Like any other website, I should be pointing to where the images are hosted online, not where they are hosted locally (Duh!). With a little research, it looks like images hosted within the same Github repo as the pages are hosted from should start with a reference to the repository. In my case, my repository is called <strong>techblog</strong> so my image reference will need to look like this:</p>
<p><code>![single-html-image-directory-map-fail](/techblog/images/customize-hugo/single-html-image-directory-map-fail.png)</code></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The reference above is for the link referenced in this article. Circular logic is the best!</p>
<p>You should immediately see the reference while using checking locally using hugo (<code>hugo server -D --disableFastRender</code>), and have the images show on your live website once you sync the updates back to Github and the action takes place to publish the update to Github pages.</p>
<h2 id="learnings">Learnings</h2>
<p>Put simply, keep it simple! To be fair, I am not a web developer by trade. As with the case normally though, the solution is normally more simple than an over-thinker like me typically thinks it is.</p>
