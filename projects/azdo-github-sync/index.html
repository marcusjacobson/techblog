Project Goal
Create a one-way sync from Azure DevOps to GitHub, for the purpose of publishing projects created in Azure DevOps to the shareable GitHub repo.
Project Outcomes
Upon running the pipeline in AzureDevops, any new or changed files in the Azure DevOps repo will be updated in the GitHub repository.
Limitations:

Due to the allowable permissions for GitHub personal access tokens, only read & write permissions are allowed, but delete permissions are not available. Therefore any deleted files in the Azure DevOps will not be deleted in GitHub.
Any files that are moved within Azure DevOps will be duplicated, one version in each locations. Therefore any deleted or moved files will need to be manually remediated in GitHub.
Another remediation option would be to empty the GitHub repository and then run the pipeline again in Azure DevOps. This will make sure that only the most recent files and folder structure is live in GitHub.

For the most efficient use of this pipeline, it is recommended to follow the branching practices below:</p><ul><li>Any time you intend to make edits within the Azure DevOps repo, first create a branch off of main.</li><li>Make your edits within the branch.</li><li>Once the edits are completed within the branch, run a pull request back into main. This action will cause the pipeline to run to back up any changes to GitHub.</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> While making changes directly in main will not &ldquo;break&rdquo; the backup process, it will cause the pipeline to run every time a change is committed, which is overkill and not a great use of the VM pools used to run pipelines. If you intend to make changes directly in Main, it is recommended to change the trigger value within github-sync,yml to <strong>none</strong>, and then run the pipeline manually when you intend to push your changes to GitHub.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-yml data-lang=yml><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#f92672>trigger</span>:
