&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of weeks since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on the Hugo site. However, I came back to it today to work on building out the Portfolio page that I created as a placeholder in the past, to get this site closer to something I&amp;rsquo;d be more comfortable sharing with the world. I started by filling out details within the placeholder markdown file I created before. Here were my goals:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo - Fixing broken image links</title><link>https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/hugo-images/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/hugo-images/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-hugo-images-were-broken">My Hugo images were broken!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Quick update for today, with another Hugo tip. As I have worked with markdown before, specifically while managing Wikis in Azure DevOps and GitHub, I simply created a subdirectory within my repository in the same area as the markdown files for my articles, and then pointed to my image files using the typical syntax of &lt;code>![alt text](imagelink)&lt;/code>. When building my site within Hugo, it even properly ported these image files into the &lt;strong>public&lt;/strong> site files, however no matter what I did, my links were broken.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hugo - Customize the Ananke Theme</title><link>https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/customize-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/customize-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="continuing-the-hugo-journey">Continuing the Hugo Journey&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As discussed in the previous Blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to host my own tech blog site using the Hugo platform and hosting through GitHub pages. Today I decided to play with the platform a little more and see if I could extend my site to multiple pages and make it more of a personal homepage along with the blog. With this goal in mind, I worked on the following items:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>First Blog Post - Creating this Blog</title><link>https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/deploy-hugo-site/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/deploy-hugo-site/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="why-i-created-this-blog">Why I created this blog&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>My name is Marcus, and I am an IT professional focused in Azure Cloud Deployments, and working to improve my skills in the Security and AI spaces. This blog is meant to be a space for me to focus on the following subjects:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Discussions on personal projects I am working on&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Details on deployments with screenshots and code snippets, to help others as they come across the content&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Posts relating to learning activities I am working on, including certifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This blog is posted using the Hugo framework within GitHub pages. I chose this method since it is a free way to host content and it allows me to still have the control around content publishing and site theming.
