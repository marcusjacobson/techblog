Project Introduction
I work in Azure DevOps daily to deploy resources using Azure using pipelines. Therefore, I have a high familiarity with using Azure DevOps for deployments and build both personal and professional projects in the environment. However, I also want to be able to share my personal projects more widely using GitHub, since it is a more recognized tool for this purpose. I also want to consolidate all of my projects in one place (GitHub), regardless of whether they were built using Azure DevOps."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.142.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/techblog/ananke/css/main.min.02af28dbd823e93b59e44e89bcb1eaae8e61a2fc5207b4d2ed0f638a96588a32.css><link rel=canonical href=https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/project-sync-azdo-to-gh/><meta property="og:url" content="https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/project-sync-azdo-to-gh/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Tech Portfolio - Marcus Jacobson"><meta property="og:title" content="Project Release - Sync an Azure DevOps repo to GitHub"><meta property="og:description" content="Project Page: GitHub-Sync

Therefore, I have a high familiarity with using Azure DevOps for deployments and build both personal and professional projects in the environment. However, I also want to be able to share my personal projects more widely using GitHub, since it is a more recognized tool for this purpose. I also want to consolidate all of my projects in one place (GitHub), regardless of whether they were built using Azure DevOps.</p><p>While I could easily just manually copy and paste files between by Azure DevOps repo and my GitHub repository, I thought it would be an interesting thought exercise to see if I could figure out how to automate it using Azure Pipelines.</p><h2 id=building-the-project>Building the project</h2><p>I built the project using a similar method that I use for most project in Azure DevOps. The main components are:</p><ul><li>Pipeline file - used by Azure Pipelines to automate the deployment.</li><li>Pipleine-variables file - used to define the variables needed for the pipeline to run, such as the GitHub personal access token and Azure DevOps service connection.</li><li>Script file - the pipeline is designed to run the script every time a run is initiated. The script contains the logic to perform the sync.</li></ul><p>I started by searching the internet to see if I could find any existing tools that could perform this sync, but I wasn&rsquo;t able to find any solutions that were available off the shelf. There were some scripts that people published that provide ways to deploy the git commands manually (which I did use for inspiration), but they all required manual authentication which would not work within a pipeline.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There is an Azure Boards plugin for GitHub which serves to sync work items between Azure Boards and GitHub Projects, but does not provide a solution to sync the repo contents.</p><p>Therefore I started down the path of:</p><ol><li>Learning how to set up a programmatic link between GitHub and Azure DevOps. This is done by first setting up a <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens>Fine-Grained GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)</a>, and then creating an <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops">Azure DevOps Service Connection</a> that links to GitHub, and enter the PAT into the service connection.</li><li>Learning the correct <strong>git</strong> commands to perform the sync and saving it into a <strong>.sh</strong> file.</li><li>Learning the way to call the Shell script within Azure Pipelines, and which variables are required to run the pipeline and pass to the script.</li><li>Create the pipeline-variables link according to the values needed in step 3, and reference the pipeline file.</li><li>Test and adjust accordingly until I achieved the results I was looking for.</li></ol><h2 id=project-limitations>Project limitations</h2><p>Due to limitations of the GitHub PAT, only write and update permissions are allowed, therefore the following idiosyncrasies are in place:</p><ul><li>Deleted files in Azure DevOps will need to be remediated manually in GitHub.</li><li>Moved files in Azure DevOps will be duplicated, one instance of the original location and one instance of the new location.</li></ul><p>The project page goes into more details on how to remediate these situations.</p><h2 id=project-specifics>Project specifics</h2><p>To learn more about this project and link to where it is hosted in GitHub, see the <a href=/techblog/projects/azdo-github-sync/>GitHub-Sync project page</a>. This contains more specifics on how the project was built, link to the project files in GitHub, and instructions to reuse it.</p><h2 id=learnings>Learnings</h2><p>Most of the scripting work I perform daily within Azure DevOps is performed in PowerShell, however the best language I could find to use to run the required git commands is <strong>Shell</strong>. Therefore, I had to learn how to write the commands I wanted to do within Shell, and also learn how to build the pipeline file to use the Shell script. GitHub Copilot in VS Code was a great resource for this, however (as per usual) I am not satisfied with deploying any code unless I understand how it works. Therefore, I made sure to add appropriate comments throughout the script so any future user will also know what each action does.</p><p>I spent some time trying to figure out how I can sync deleted/moved items, but then I came to the realization that this is a limitation of the GitHub PAT.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-forest-green bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/>&copy; Tech Portfolio - Marcus Jacobson 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
