As I have been adding more blog posts, I realized that I needed to start sorting them by category, to make finding relevant articles in the future easier. Fortunately, with a little research, the answer to this was pretty straightforward.
Add a taxonomy section to hugo.toml
Within the hugo.toml file, I added the following section after [&ldquo;params&rdquo;]:
[taxonomies]
  category = "categories"
  tag = "tags"
This gives me the option to do both categorization and add tags in the future. For now I just added categories, since I don&rsquo;t have a search functionality on my side. If I add search later though, having the option to implement tags will be helpful.'><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.142.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/techblog/ananke/css/main.min.02af28dbd823e93b59e44e89bcb1eaae8e61a2fc5207b4d2ed0f638a96588a32.css><link rel=canonical href=https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/hugo-add-taxonomy/><meta property="og:url" content="https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/hugo-add-taxonomy/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Tech Portfolio - Marcus Jacobson"><meta property="og:title" content="Hugo - Add taxonomy to sort blog posts"><meta property="og:description" content='The need to sort blog posts As I have been adding more blog posts, I realized that I needed to start sorting them by category, to make finding relevant articles in the future easier.

At this point, I just have one - Hugo, but I&rsquo;ll be adding more in the future.</p><p>While there are many different ways to format this, I chose to use a table format so the links appear left to right across the screen. I also added in some spacers within the table so the links have some white space between them.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>Use the links below to navigate to articles on specific subjects:

It would have been nice if it was enabled by default, but figuring out how to add it didn&rsquo;t take much work. From there, it was just customizing how I wanted to present the links to my blog categories.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-forest-green bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/>&copy; Tech Portfolio - Marcus Jacobson 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
