Project Overview
If you&rsquo;ve ever found yourself manually clicking through the Azure portal to deploy resources, what starts as a simple &ldquo;quick setup&rdquo; quickly becomes hours of configuration, validation, and hoping you didn&rsquo;t miss a critical setting. That&rsquo;s exactly the problem I set out to solve with this Infrastructure as Code automation framework.
This project represents my journey to build a comprehensive solution for deploying and managing Microsoft Sentinel environments using Azure DevOps Pipelines. The goal was simple: make security operations scalable, repeatable and easy to update."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.142.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/techblog/ananke/css/main.min.02af28dbd823e93b59e44e89bcb1eaae8e61a2fc5207b4d2ed0f638a96588a32.css><link rel=canonical href=https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/sentinel-as-code-framework-overview/><meta property="og:url" content="https://marcusjacobson.github.io/techblog/posts/sentinel-as-code-framework-overview/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Tech Portfolio - Marcus Jacobson"><meta property="og:title" content="Microsoft Sentinel Infrastructure as Code - Automation Framework Overview"><meta property="og:description" content="Project page

The goal was simple: make security operations scalable, repeatable and easy to update.</p><h2 id=what-i-built>What I Built</h2><p>Rather than just another set of ARM templates, I wanted to create something that actually addressed the real-world challenges I&rsquo;ve encountered in enterprise environments.

Foundation Infrastructure Pipeline</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: [COMPLETE]</p><ul><li>Automated Resource Group creation and validation</li><li>Log Analytics Workspace deployment with enterprise settings</li><li>Microsoft Sentinel enablement with security configurations</li><li>Resource conflict detection and intelligent handling</li></ul><h3 id=2-analytics-rules-automation>2. Analytics Rules Automation</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: [COMPLETE]</p><ul><li>Near Real-Time (NRT) analytics rules with automated deployment pipelines</li><li>Scheduled analytics rules with comprehensive validation and testing</li><li>External KQL query file processing with comment and formatting preservation</li><li>Template consistency validation with detailed error reporting and rollback capabilities</li></ul><h3 id=3-watchlist-management-system>3. Watchlist Management System</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: [COMPLETE]</p><ul><li>Automated CSV processing with advanced validation</li><li>Data quality checks including type detection and duplicate identification</li><li>Schema change management with intelligent watchlist recreation</li><li>Security validation with CSV injection detection and prevention</li></ul><h3 id=4-enterprise-deployment-orchestration>4. Enterprise Deployment Orchestration</h3><p><strong>Status</strong>: [COMPLETE]</p><ul><li>Phased deployment with dependency management</li><li>Service principal authentication with role-based access control</li><li>Comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities</li><li>Detailed logging and troubleshooting documentation</li></ul><h2 id=how-it-all-fits-together>How It All Fits Together</h2><p>The architecture might look complex on paper, but the logic is straightforward once you understand the flow:</p><h3 id=deployment-phases>Deployment Phases</h3><p>The framework implements a three-phase approach in order to break up the deployment tasks into more snack-size chunks:</p><p><strong>Phase 1 - Foundation</strong>: Get the basics right first. Resource Groups, Log Analytics Workspaces, and Microsoft Sentinel enablement. Nothing else happens until this phase completes successfully.</p><p><strong>Phase 2 - Security Content</strong>: Once the foundation is solid, we can deploy analytics rules and watchlists in parallel. Each component is independent, so if one fails, the others keep going.</p><p><strong>Phase 3 - Future Extensions</strong>: Going forward, I&rsquo;m planning to add hunting queries, automation rules, and custom workbooks as the framework evolves.</p><h3 id=security-first-design>Security-First Design</h3><p>Here&rsquo;s how I approached the security requirements for the automation techniques:</p><ul><li><strong>Least Privilege Access</strong>: Service principals get exactly the permissions they need, nothing more</li><li><strong>Validation at Every Step</strong>: If it can break, we check for it before deployment</li><li><strong>Audit and Compliance</strong>: Everything gets logged because someone always asks &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo;</li></ul><h2 id=why-this-actually-matters>Why This Actually Matters</h2><p>Here is why I think exploring this automation is worth your time:</p><h3 id=operational-efficiency>Operational Efficiency</h3><p>I&rsquo;ve seen organizations spend entire days manually deploying Sentinel environments. With this framework, that same deployment takes about 15 minutes of actual work—the rest is just waiting for Azure to do its thing. Manual deployments that used to require hours of careful clicking are now just a pipeline trigger.</p><h3 id=risk-reduction>Risk Reduction</h3><p>The validation built into every component catches the most common kinds of errors. This includes KQL syntax validation, data integrity checks, template consistency verification—all the stuff that makes you confident you&rsquo;re not about to break something important.</p><h3 id=scalability>Scalability</h3><p>Once you get this working in one environment, deploying to additional subscriptions, regions, or business units becomes trivial. The standardized approach means you can scale without losing your mind trying to remember what you did differently in each environment.</p><h2 id=lessons-learned>Lessons Learned</h2><h3 id=what-worked-well>What Worked Well</h3><ul><li>Investing heavily in validation and error handling paid off big time. When something goes wrong (and it always does), the detailed logging and validation statistics give you actual useful information instead of the usual &ldquo;something went wrong, good luck figuring out what.&rdquo;</li><li>The Azure DevOps integration patterns turned out to be surprisingly portable. Organizations with existing DevOps workflows could drop this into their existing pipeline structures without having to rethink their entire approach.</li></ul><h3 id=the-technical-breakthroughs>The Technical Breakthroughs</h3><ul><li>External KQL file processing with comment preservation for the analytics rules turned out to be way more important than I initially thought. Security analysts want to write their queries with proper comments and formatting, but automation systems typically strip all that out. Finding a way to preserve the human-readable elements while still automating the deployment was the key to getting security teams on board.</li><li>Handling existing resources intelligently was another crucial piece. In enterprise environments, you&rsquo;re rarely starting from a clean slate. The framework needed to be smart enough to update existing configurations without breaking things that were already working.</li></ul><h3 id=the-big-picture-lesson>The Big Picture Lesson</h3><p>Treat this as infrastructure automation, not security tool configuration. When you frame it as infrastructure, it fits naturally into existing change management and deployment approval processes. When you treat it as &ldquo;just another security tool,&rdquo; it becomes this weird special case that doesn&rsquo;t fit anywhere.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s Next</h2><p>This framework is definitely not finished. Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on next:</p><h3 id=planned-automation-expansions>Planned Automation Expansions</h3><ul><li><strong>Hunting Queries</strong>: Deploy hunting queries quickly and easily using templates and automation</li><li><strong>Automation Rules</strong>: Logic Apps and playbook deployment with actual workflow automation</li><li><strong>Workbooks</strong>: Custom dashboard and reporting automation with streamlined template management</li></ul><h3 id=integration-opportunities>Integration Opportunities</h3><p>The beauty of building this with a standardized pipeline approach is that the patterns extend beyond just Sentinel. I&rsquo;m already thinking about how to apply the same concepts to other Microsoft security solutions and even third-party security platforms.</p><h2 id=want-to-try-it-yourself>Want to Try It Yourself?</h2><p>If this sounds like something you&rsquo;d find useful, here&rsquo;s how to get started:</p><p>Begin with the foundation infrastructure components and gradually expand to security content automation. The complete implementation guide, including all the configuration details and troubleshooting tips I wish I&rsquo;d had when I started, is available in the <a href=https://github.com/marcusjacobson/Projects/tree/main/Microsoft/Sentinel/Sentinel-as-Code>GitHub repository</a>.</p><h3 id=what-youll-need>What You&rsquo;ll Need</h3><ul><li>Azure subscription with appropriate permissions (obvious, but worth stating)</li><li>Azure DevOps organization with pipeline capabilities</li><li>Service principal with the required security roles</li><li>Basic familiarity with Bicep templates and PowerShell (if you&rsquo;re comfortable with JSON and can read PowerShell, you&rsquo;ll be fine.
